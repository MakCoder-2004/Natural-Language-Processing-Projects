# 📝 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects

Welcome to my **Natural Language Processing Projects** repository is a curated collection of implementations, experiments, and mini-projects crafted to strengthen and expand my skills in text processing, language modeling, and modern NLP techniques.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my continuous journey in mastering **NLP** and its practical applications. It contains hands-on projects built using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **scikit-learn**, and powerful NLP frameworks such as **spaCy**, **Gensim**, and **fastText**. Each project focuses on translating theory into real-world tasks, covering everything from traditional text processing to advanced transformer-based models.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

A growing set of implementations featuring:

* **Text Preprocessing Pipelines** – tokenization, cleaning, normalization, regex-based text handling
* **Feature Engineering Techniques** – Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, n-grams
* **Word Embedding Models** – Word2Vec, GloVe, fastText, BERT embeddings
* **Sequence Models** – RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs
* **Transformers & Attention Models** – modern architectures for cutting-edge NLP tasks
* Utility scripts and experiments for text representation, training, and evaluation

Every project includes components such as:

* Dataset loading, cleaning, and text preprocessing
* Feature extraction using classic and modern embedding methods
* Model training and hyperparameter tuning
* Evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, and more
* Optional deployment or inference utilities
